Integration testing with the KumuluzEE framework has just become a lot easier with the
[KumuluzEE Arquillian Container Adapter](https://github.com/kumuluz/kumuluzee-testing/blob/master/kumuluzee-arquillian-container/README.md).

The newly developed adapter brings support for the popular [Arquillian](http://arquillian.org/) framework. KumuluzEE
Arquillian Container Adapter starts the KumuluzEE server before running the tests, which enables the tests to interact
with the environment closely resembling the one in production.

The Arquillian framework allows you to build and run multiple different deployments built programmatically. For example,
see the following two classes, in which a simple JAR is built and the CDI interaction is tested:

`SimpleBean.java`:

```java
@Dependent
public class SimpleBean {

    public String sayHello() {
        return "bean-hello";
    }
}
```

`InjectTest.java`:

```java
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
public class InjectTest {

    @Deployment
    public static JavaArchive createDeployment() {
        return ShrinkWrap.create(JavaArchive.class)
                .addClass(SimpleBean.class)
                .addAsManifestResource(EmptyAsset.INSTANCE, "beans.xml");
    }

    @Inject
    private SimpleBean bean;

    @Test
    public void injectTest() {
        Assert.assertNotNull(bean);
        Assert.assertEquals("bean-hello", bean.sayHello());
    }
}
```

The adapter is currently in the SNAPSHOT phase. Check it out and if you find any issues, please report them on GitHub.
